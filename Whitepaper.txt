** Code name: domoNYC
** Language to use: Python
** Inception date: July 15, 2013

** Purpose: This is a white paper defining software that displays tweets using color and geolocation for a uniquely visual view
** of people's tweets in specific locations. For example, after the 2012 Presidential election, searching for 'Obama' should
** display a smattering of tweets across the nation where Obama has won to have positive words such as 'happy' to be dense
** while places where Romney was the favorite to have words such as 'sad' to be dense. Coloring each word green, and red, respectively
** would provide a geospatial colored view of the state of the nation (green = happy, red = sad).

** Use Cases:
* Use Case One: I'd like to see all tweets within a specific location (visually) with key words highlighted using specific colors (happy = green, sad = red)
* Use Case Two: I'd like to see the trending topics for a nation with key words highlighted using specific colors (happy = green, sad = red)
-- This might not be a good use case as trending topics are generally pretty shitty (eg bieberfever, hiphop, angry, etc.)

* Use Case Three (Tweet Mood Use Case): Visually placing tweets based on their location would be a better display of trending (not 'topics' but,) moods in specific areas
This provides a better view of a global pulse. 
-- We need to be able to search for specific keywords when populating the map, otherwise the range of data being placed onto 
the map becomes incoherent.
-- Use Case 3: I'd like to see the trending mood for Obama after the 2012 Presidential Election for each location in a visually stimulating map.
Solution: Display global map, provide search box, populate map with twitter feed results after search box is populated with 'Obama' where tweets are then:
   	1. highlighted based on mood (eg happy = green, sad = red; dictionary of word/color pairs required).
   	2. geolocation placed accordingly
   		
* Use Case 4 (Tweet Count Use Case): I'd like to see the number of tweets for a specific topic based on location - visual will be very different here.
Visual should be 'statistics view' with dots indicating per 10,000 tweets in the last hour or something - this will provide a 
'trending' indicator based on location, which is more specific then the trending topic.


** Functional Requirements:
1. Map API (Google Maps, MAP, etc.?) - has to be zoomable and will fire various GET commands to the twitter API depending on the zoom level.
1b. Map API then has to redraw unique divisions to place resulting text in.
1c. Text also has to be processed and highlighted according to a data dictionary (word/color pairs).

2. Twitter API (search, and get resulting tweets with geolocations)
2b. Search decisions - are search terms searched as Hashtags or text content?
2c. Search distinctions: https://dev.twitter.com/docs/using-search
2d. How advanced does the search capability have to be, or should be? I think it should stay simple
2e. PROPOSAL: Search terms are searched as plain text, and hashtags can be searched by adding a hashtag to the search query

3. A good way to display text in non-traditional spaces (e.g. country shaped divs, city shaped divs, etc.)
3b. How much text should fit at each zoom-level? What size should the text be? How should each tweet be delimited?
